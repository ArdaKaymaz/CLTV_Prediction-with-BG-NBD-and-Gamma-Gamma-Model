BG-NBD and Gamma-Gamma Model BG-NBD (Beta Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution) and Gamma-Gamma models are two statistical models used for calculating customer lifetime value (CLTV). These models take into account several variables to provide more accurate results for estimating customer lifetime value.

The BG-NBD model analyzes customer purchase behavior and predicts how often customers are likely to make future purchases. It also predicts when customers are likely to churn. The Gamma-Gamma model, on the other hand, predicts how much customers will spend on each purchase transaction.

Using these two models, the CLTV formula can be expanded as follows:

CLTV = Purchase Frequency using BG-NBD * Average Order Value using Gamma-Gamma
